# IoT-IDS
The IoT-IDS framework consists of the following:
1. Wireless Hotspot Visualizer for monitoring live wireless access points.
2. Rogue Access Point detection system.
3. Wireless hostspot setup configuration using `hostapd`
4. MITM detection and defense algorithm

**NB** All python codes are written using python2.7.15
