# TLD Parser in Go

The `tld` package has the same API ([see godoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/go-tld)) as `net/url` except `tld.URL` contains extra fields: `Subdomain`, `Domain`, `TLD` and `Port`.

_Note:_ This was written for fun, please use http://golang.org/x/net/publicsuffix instead.

### Install

```
go get github.com/jpillora/go-tld
```

### Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/jpillora/go-tld"
)

func main() {
	urls := []string{
		"http://google.com",
		"http://blog.google",
		"https://www.medi-cal.ca.gov/",
		"https://ato.gov.au",
		"http://a.very.complex-domain.co.uk:8080/foo/bar",
	}
	for _, url := range urls {
		u, _ := tld.Parse(url)
		fmt.Printf("%50s = [ %s ] [ %s ] [ %s ] [ %s ] [ %s ]\n",
			u, u.Subdomain, u.Domain, u.TLD, u.Port, u.Path)
	}
}
```

```
$ go run main.go
                                 http://google.com = [  ] [ google ] [ com ] [  ] [  ]
                                http://blog.google = [  ] [ blog ] [ google ] [  ] [  ]
                      https://www.medi-cal.ca.gov/ = [ www.medi-cal ] [ ca ] [ gov ] [  ] [ / ]
                                https://ato.gov.au = [  ] [ ato ] [ gov.au ] [  ] [  ]
   http://a.very.complex-domain.co.uk:8080/foo/bar = [ a.very ] [ complex-domain ] [ co.uk ] [ 8080 ] [ /foo/bar ]
```
